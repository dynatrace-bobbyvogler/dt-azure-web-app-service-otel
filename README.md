# Exploring OneAgent and OpenTelemetry monitoring with Azure Web App Services
In this tutorial, we will explore how Dynatrace can monitor and ingest traces from an Azure Web App Service through the three main deployment options.

	• Native Dynatrace Azure Web App Service OneAgent Extension
	• OpenTelemetry (Otel) via OTLP
	• Native Dynatrace Azure Web App Service OneAgent Extension + OpenTelemetry 


Note:

* As the base application is a simple .NET application, this could be deployed in any other fashion (VM in the cloud, containerized, OneAgent on your Windows laptop, etc...).

## This repo includes three branches for each of the above deployment options. 
### Main:

Basic .NET application to be deployed to an App Service and monitored with the Dynatrace OneAgent on Azure App Service.

------
### Otel:

Basic .NET application to be deployed or ran locally to collect Otel traces and metadata and send via OTLP to the Dynatrace SaaS endpoint. 

------
### Otel-oneagent:

Basic .NET application to be deployed to an App Service, monitored with the Dynatrace OneAgent on Azure App Service and trace generation through Otel.

------
	

## Pre-requisites: 

* Dynatrace SaaS tenant.

* Dynatrace API token for Otel ingest.

* Azure environment access.

## Steps:

* After cloning the repo, make sure to follow the install steps for .NET Otel from the Dynatrace documentation: https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/shortlink/otel-wt-dotnet#manually-instrument-your-application

* After Otel packages are installed, you should be able to run the application with:
  ```
  dotnet run
  ```
* To deploy to an Azure Web App Service, follow these instructions from the Azure documentation: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-dotnetcore?tabs=net80&pivots=development-environment-vscode

* To deploy the OneAgent extension, follow this documentation: https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/shortlink/azure-appservice-oneagent#portal

* Once the app is deployed, click on the tracing tab at the top of the applicaiton. Then click on the button "Start trace" a few times to generate somee traffic. You can then see the traces coming in within the Distributed Tracing app in Dynatrace.

### Author Notes:

As there is an Azure Web App Service free trial tier, I was able to deploy two of these branches to one App Service Plan, then had to create another App Service Plan for the remaining deployment.

### For Dynatrace Sprint Tenants:

Downloading the OneAgent extension on Azure requires a different server URL for the tenant. 
By running the API call below, we are able to grab an ActiveGate service that is associated with your sprint tenant.

```
/api/v1/deployment/installer/agent/connectioninfo/endpoints
```

For example, mine was:
```
https://xx-xx-xxxxxxx-xx-cluster-acceptancee2e.sprint.dynatracelabs.com/e/<tenantId>/api
